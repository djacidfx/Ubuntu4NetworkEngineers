# Using Ubuntu

Switching from Windows to Ubuntu with the Gnome desktop is both easy and hard. How can that be? It's simple, the basic operation of the desktop is similar to Windows. The file manager (Nautilus) is similar to Windows Explorer and of course Chrome or Firefox work just like they do in Windows including syncing, Extensions, etc. There is a keyboard button called the superkey (on most keyboards it will have the Windows logo) just like the Windows key. You tap it and search for an application or pick from the running applications.

So, what is the hard part? Things like killing a hung application, searching for files from the terminal, checking free disk space are different and will take a little getting used to. Since MacOS is based on Open BSD Unix,
once your muscle memory is up to speed you will be able to jump back and forth easily between Windows, Mac and Linux. In a later chapter I will discuss the terminal tools that make Linux so much fun and so powerful for
a network engineer.

One of the big advantages for the Linux desktop is that you can customize almost everything since it’s free and open source. You can change the terminal you use, the file manager, the way almost anything works and even the desktop itself.

The most popular desktop environments (DE) for Linux are Gnome (Ubuntu’s default), and KDE (which is available on Ubuntu) but there are many more. I use the computer for work and just learned to customize Gnome to fit my workflow but I use Terminator for my terminal app.

I listen to a lot of podcasts and KDE Plasma, XFCE and MATE are highly recommended desktop environments (DE) that you may like better than Gnome. If you watched the second episode of Mr. Robot (Season 1 – which I highly recommend) there is a scene were an executive tells Elliot that he runs KDE but
understands why Elliott prefers Gnome.

These two short YouTube videos sum it up better than I can:

### Podcasts on Linux

There are a lot of podcasts dedicated to Linux. In your podcast application just search Linux. My favorites are:

- Destination Linux - A weekly podcast on general Open Source topics.
- Linux Unplugged - A weekly podcast on Linux by Jupiter Broadcasting. Covers news and applications for Linux.
- Late Night Linux - A weekly podcast on Linux and the wider tech industry.
- Linux After Dark - A weekly podcast on Linux experiences.
- Linux Downtime - A weekly podcast "From working in the Industry and progressing your career, to managing a projects community"

### Casting your display

I have a Vizio “Smart” TV with Chromecast built in. Using the Chrome browser I can click the three dot menu on the right and select “Cast...” to send the output to the TV.

In VLC, select “Playback, Renderer” to send VLC’s output to the TV. I don’t have a Chromecast dongle, but I am guessing it would work the same way as the Vizio TV.

## Opening Applications

You can hit the Windows key (Superkey is what it's called in Ubuntu) to bring up a search box. Below the search box are the applications that are currently running. You can use the Tab key and enter or use the mouse
to select one of the running applications.

Notice that the files application icon has two dots on the left side. If you click on the icon, the screen will change to show the two files windows.
