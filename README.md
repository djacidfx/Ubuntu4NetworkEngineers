Advance your “Network Engineer of the future” career with the OS of the Cloud

## Who is this guide written for?

Any network engineer or admin running Microsoft Windows! I used MS Windows from Windows 3.1 up until Windows 8 came out. At that time I had been using Linux for things like [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/downloads/nagios-core/) and the Asterisk VoIP system but not as a daily driver. Windows 8 pushed me over the edge!

Once I started working with Python and Cisco DevOps, it became clear that Linux is a better choice for a network Engineer. Tools like nmap work better under Linux ([raw socket support](https://antonio-cooler.gitbook.io/coolervoid-tavern/port-knocking-from-the-scratch)), you have access to sophisticated [terminal emulators](https://itsfoss.com/linux-terminal-emulators/) like Terminator, Alacritty, Tilix Terminal, etc. and different shells (what most people call "the Terminal"). This guide will show you how to switch from BASH to ZSH in a later chapter.

* Network Engineers can use this guide to get started with Linux and then to customize their daily driver to fit the unique needs of a network engineer.
* Network Administrators will find Unix tools like grep, sed, awk, and arp-scan useful in their day to day operation. These tools are discussed in "Working in the Terminal".
* Security Personnel will find a plethora of open source tools available for Linux. Many of these tools are discussed in the DNS chapter and in the networking tools chapter.
* A Curious student who wants to learn about Linux, Open Source, and NetDevOps.

This guide is written assuming that you have skills in MS Windows, Putty, Network devices, and a desire to learn how Linux can make you a better, more efficient engineer.
